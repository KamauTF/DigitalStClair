    <h2>Kamau</h2>
    <p>My name is pronounced (Ka-mow) I’m a charismatic individual with an experienced customer service background, along with a demonstrated history of working in the Development Disabled Industry. I have strong skills in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel & PowerPoint. Right after highschool I attended Wheelock College. Seeing as though it wasn’t the best fit for me I decided to further my education back home where I enrolled in Holyoke Community College. There I found an interest in Computer Science which lead me to start my quest on a career in Information Technology. My short term goal is to establish myself within a company geared towards developing technical skills in the IT workplace. </p>
